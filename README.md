- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m F. Javier Gimeno Ortiz
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in videogame development / programming, gaming (obvious), anime, music and art.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently a "fresh" year student at ESAT (Escuela Superior de Arte y Tecnologia) in the HND in videogame programming course.
- ðŸŒ± I have a dusty guitar that I've been trying to learn with no luck, hit me up if you want to teach me ðŸ‘€.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at @nosfyt on Twitter and Instagram (barely use the last one).
